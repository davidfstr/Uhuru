# Uhuru

Uhuru is a translation assistant for reading Japanese text quickly.

Just paste in some Japanese text or dialogue, and hover over some words
to immediately look up their meanings based on the [EDICT] dictionary.
Kanji characters are also looked up based on the [Remembering the Kanji]
keywords.

Uhuru is named after the original Shahili word that inspired the
name of [Uhura] from the original Star Trek series, a famous translator.
Since "uhuru" ends in -ru, it reminds me of a る-verb.

> 「おはよう、稲叢さん。いつもご飯、ありがとう」
> 
> 「いいえいえ、気にしないで下さい。料理は好きですから」
> 
> 「そうか。そう言ってもらえると……」
> 
> 「稲叢さんの料理は、自分で作るよりも美味しいから、凄く助かってる。ありがとう」
